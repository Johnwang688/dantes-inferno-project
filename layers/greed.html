                <h3>Ingredient: Dense Nut-Filled Chocolate Brownie</h3>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong>
                    The greedy obsessed over material wealth, 
                    hoarding or squandering it excessively. 
                    They are punished by endlessly pushing massive weights
                    against each other in opposite directions. 
                    The dense, heavy brownie packed with nuts mirrors the weight of the hoarded possessions.
                    While it appears delicious and sweet, it is actually a burden to consume, as 
                    it is too hard and dense to eat comfortably.
                    The nuts represent the rocks that the greedy are forced to push against each other. 
                    As someone bites into the brownie and crunch their teeth on the nuts,
                    they experience the pushing of two "rocks" against each other (teeth crunching on nuts).
                    This is a metaphor for the endless labor imposed on the greedy, 
                    as they are forced to push the weight of their hoarded possessions against each other for eternity.
                </p>
