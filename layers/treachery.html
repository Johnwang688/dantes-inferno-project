                <h3>Ingredient: Hard-Frozen Vanilla Ice Cream</h3>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong>
                    Traitors betrayed family, country, guests, or benefactors. 
                    They are encased in the frozen lake Cocytus, furthest from God's warmth, 
                    with Satan himself frozen waist-deep at the center. 
                    The hard-frozen ice cream is extremely cold, solid, and isolating, 
                    reflecting the absolute absence of warmth in treachery. 
                    The vanilla ice cream becomes numbing and solid when frozen, an inedible
                    chunk of ice. This icy layer emphasizes Dante's theology 
                    that deliberate betrayal deserves the harshest, coldest punishment.
                    The ice cream represents the treachery of the sinners,
                    as they forced others to suffer coldness and betrayal.
                    The ice cream is also a metaphor for the frozen lake Cocytus,
                    as it is a symbol of the coldness and isolation of the sinners.
                    This ingredient highlights the treacherous nature of betrayal,
                    as it is a sin that corrupts the mind and heart of the sinner
                    and brings great harm to others.
