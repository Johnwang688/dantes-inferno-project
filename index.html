                This dessert represents Dante's depiction of Hell 
                as a descending structure of worsening sin and punishment,
                 shown through increasingly unpleasant textures and temperatures,
                  and a progression from a mild, tasteless ingredient to deceptive sweetness 
                  to burning heat and finally frozen isolation.
                  The dessert as a whole symbolizes Hell as a place where 
                  sin and punishment begins deceptively mild but grows heavier, 
                  more painful, and ultimately numbingly cold the deeper 
                  one goes. This progression mirrors how sins become more deliberate, 
                  evil, and further from God's love.
                The layered structure reflects Dante's moral order 
                by placing the least terrible punishment (Limbo) at the 
                top. Limbo is light and flavorless, like suspended longing, then 
                descending through sins of incontinence in upper layers of Hell (Gluttony, Greed), 
                violence, fraud, and finally treachery at the frozen bottom, 
                illustrating that deliberate betrayal of love is the most severe 
                sin, furthest from divine warmth.

    <div class = "structural-analysis">
        <h3>Structural Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            As the circles descend, Dante arranges sin by worsening moral logic:
             wrongdoing becomes more deliberate, more exploitative, and more resistant
              to love and reason. Upper layers punish failures of self-control 
              (lust, gluttony, greed), but lower layers punish deliberate sins:
               violence, fraud, and treachery. The structure reveals the worsening nature of sin. 
               the upper layers will eventually lead to the lower layers. Lust causes gluttony, as one
               becomes so obsessed with food that they become gluttonous. Gluttony causes greed,
               as one hoards wealth to buy more things that they want. 
        </p>

    <div class = "purpose-and-theme">
        <h3>Purpose and Theme</h3>
        <p>
            Through the structure of Hell, Dante argues that sin is ultimately 
            a willful rejection of God's love and order, which my dessert 
            represents by sinking into darker, denser layers that become 
            tighter and more broken as you descend.

    <div class = "conclusion"> 
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Creating this dessert made Inferno feel less like a list of punishments
              and more like a moral system with a clear direction. Everything
              darkens, worsens, and becomes more intentional as you descend. I had to think 
              about why each circle belongs where it does, and how the structure 
              itself communicates Dante's theology about choosing sin over love. 
              Translating that logic into flavors and layers forced me to connect 
              ideas like intention, harm, and betrayal to something concrete, 
              not just abstract themes.
