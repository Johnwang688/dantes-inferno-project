                This dessert represents Dante's depiction of Hell as a descending structure of worsening
                sins and punishments. The dessert is layered in a way that mirrors the structure of Hell,
                as the top layers are more mild and tasteless, while the bottom layers are more intense, with 
                increasingly interesting and unique flavors and textures.
                The progression from mild to intense mirrors the progression of sins from simple sins of 
                incontinence to more severe, deliberate sins of fraud, violence, and treachery.

        <h3>Structural Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Dante arranges the circles of Hell by increasingly severe sins. 
            The upper layers punish failures of self-control 
            (lust, gluttony, greed). The lower layers punish more severe, deliberate sins (fraud, violence, treachery).
             This structure reveals the worsening nature of sins, as
               the upper layers lead to the lower layers. Lust causes gluttony, as one
               becomes so obsessed with food that they become gluttonous. Gluttony causes greed,
               as one hoards wealth to buy more things that they want. Greed causes violence, as people
               kill to get what they want. Similarly, fraud and treachery are also caused by greed,
               as people lie and betray to get more money, power, control, etc.

        <h3>Purpose and Theme</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the structure of Hell, Dante argues that sin is ultimately 
            a willful rejection of God's love and order, which the dessert 
            represents by increasingly unique and unexpected flavors and textures.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Layer 7: Violence was the hardest for me to symbolize. There aren't many dessert foods that can 
            accurately symbolize the river of boiling blood. If I put anything sweet it would not fit
            the theme of pain and violence in the layer. I didn't know what to put in that layer 
            and ended up putting spicy chili chocolate ganache after looking up a bunch of different red foods. 
            The spice combined with the chocolate makes it a perfect symbol for the river of blood.
