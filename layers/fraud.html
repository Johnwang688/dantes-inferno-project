                <h3>Ingredient: Vanilla Custard with Hidden Bitter Dark Chocolate Chunks</h3>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong>
                    Fraudulent sinners deceived others by misusing their gift of intelligence.
                    Their punishments in Malebolge reflect the deceitfulness of their actions.
                    The smooth, sweet vanilla custard 
                    appears delicious on the surface but conceals 
                    bitter, unexpected dark chocolate bits. This hidden bitterness 
                    symbolizes betrayal of trust and false appearances. When one bites 
                    into the custard expecting sweetness, they are instead met with bitterness,
                    mirroring the false appearance of the fraudsters. The color and texture
                    of the dark chocolate reflects the imagery of excrement 
                    and filth that the fraudsters are forced to endure. 
                    The chocolate chunks represent the deceitful actions of the fraudsters,
                    as they are forced to eat the excrement and filth that they have caused others to endure.
                    This ingredient highlights the deceptive nature of fraud,
                    as it is a sin that corrupts the mind and heart of the sinner.
